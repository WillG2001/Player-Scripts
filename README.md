# Overview

This repository contains C# scripts for a Unity first-person shooter game demo. The scripts allow the player to move in the 4 cardinal directions, jump, move the camera by moving the mouse, sprint, and crouch.

These scripts were written so I could gain more experience with writing C# scripts for Unity games. I will adapt these scripts for my 3D platformer game project.

# Development Environment

The game is being developed in Unity Game Engine. I used Visual Studio Code to write the scripts.

I used C# and the Unity Game Engine libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Continue to add more movement options
* Play around with different settings to provide the smoothest movement experience
* The FPS game will be a base for the 3D platformer, as such, a third-person camera that follows the player will need to be implemented
